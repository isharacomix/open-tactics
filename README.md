Open Tactics
============
Open tactics is an engine/game/experiment in developing turn-based tactical
wargames (and I suppose could be extended to RPGs). The focus on this project
is making an engine that is lightweight enough to support extensible rules
such as new units, terrain, and balancing without rewriting the Python source
code.

I'm theoretically developing this game for [One Game a Month][1gam], and I'm
livestreaming development nightly from 10-midnight EST on [my website][].
