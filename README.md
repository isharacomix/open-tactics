Rules of War
============
Rules of War is a game/engine/experiment for developing turn-based tactical
wargames.

The thing that makes this game unique is that the rules of the game are often in
flux from match to match. In one battle, tanks might be very strong. In another,
they might be very weak. In another, they might be able to fly. The ultimate
guiding philosophy for this game is

> Editing the rules of the game should be as straightforward as designing a
> new map.

I'm theoretically developing this game for [One Game a Month][1gam], and I'm
livestreaming development nightly from 10-midnight EST on [my website][].


Impatient Person's Instructions
-------------------------------
Install Pygame and run the 'rules-of-war.py' launcher. Select the map
"Intro.json" and pick play. Type the name of the first player, press down,
then type the name of the second player. Press Enter and the game will
begin.

When it's your turn, move the cursor with the arrow keys and press Enter
to select units and properties. At the start of the game, you will have
no units. Move the cursor over the "$" icon and press enter. A "$" is a
factory. Factories let you build units. You can't move the unit until your
next turn. To move units, press the Enter key over them, select their
destination within the highlighted range, and press Enter again. Press the
enter key anywhere else on the map to end your turn and let the other player
move.

If you ever mess up, you can always undo your last move or completely start
over, so feel free to experiment. Your turn isn't over until you say it is.
Right now, the game only supports hotseat multiplayer, so don't keep your
opponent waiting *too* long.

If you need more help, press "?".
