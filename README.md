Rules of War
============
Rules of War is a game/engine/experiment for developing turn-based tactical
wargames.

The thing that makes this game unique is that the rules of the game are often in
flux from match to match. In one battle, tanks might be very strong. In another,
they might be very weak. In another, they might be able to fly. The ultimate
guiding philosophy for this game is

> Editing the rules of the game should be as straightforward as designing a
> new map.

I'm theoretically developing this game for [One Game a Month][1gam], and I'm
livestreaming development nightly from 10-midnight EST on [my website][].
